# Triangle Type Classifier - SQL

This repository contains a SQL query that identifies the type of each record in the `TRIANGLES` table based on its three side lengths. The query outputs whether it's an Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene triangle, or if the given values don't form a triangle.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN
            CASE
                WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                WHEN A != B AND B != C AND A != C THEN 'Scalene'
            END
        ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
    END 
FROM TRIANGLES;
